In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been doing at work/study?
1. Planning out times to study classes
2. priotizing some free time so i wont get burnt out
3. working on things one by one so i dont get overwhelmed

What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work?
* I have a calendar of when things are due
* I use a planner to plan out my days
* I go to help hours as often as i can



I am majoring in statistics and minoring in Data Science and Economics. I am learning probabilities and other applications of statistics like forecasting. In Data science we are learning how to use data. The three things I use to be organized is a calander to write due dates on, a pencil and eraser so if I make a mistake I can erase it, and a watch so I know what time it is if I need to do something else.
